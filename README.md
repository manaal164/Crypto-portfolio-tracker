🚀 Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A full-stack Crypto Portfolio Tracker built to learn and practice real-world web development concepts like authentication, API integration, protected routes, and clean UI/UX patterns.

This project helps users track their crypto investments, view portfolio analytics, and manage investments securely — while giving me hands-on experience with production-style architecture.

🧠 Why I Built This

This project was built as a learning journey, not just a CRUD app.

Through this project, I explored:

How real authentication systems work

How frontend and backend communicate securely

How to handle protected routes and user sessions

How to replace browser alerts with proper UI notifications

How to structure a scalable full-stack project

It helped me move from “tutorial code” to real application thinking.
